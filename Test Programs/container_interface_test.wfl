// Create instances
create new Circle with 5 and "red" as circle
create new Rectangle with 10 and 20 and "blue" as rectangle

// Call methods
circle draw
rectangle draw

// Resize both shapes
circle resize with 30 and 40
rectangle resize with 50 and 60

// Draw again to see the changes
circle draw
rectangle draw

// Test complete
display "Container interface test complete"
